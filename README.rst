==========

A modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord written in Python.

The Future of discord.py
--------------------------

Please read the `gist <https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1>`_ for the future of this project. It's been a good one.

Why This Fork?
--------------

You shouldn't use this outside of `Salamander. <https://github.com/unified-moderation-network/salamander>`_ It won't be supported, and things may be changed without warning.
This is being maintained on a minimal level for now, but could end up being dropped at any point in the future should UMW no longer be relying on it.
